CAD models for 2.9 inch Waveshare battery-less NFC E-Paper displays

Companion to article at https://wp.me/paBn4l-1K7A

There are three CAD models here.

One is a CAD model of the 2.9 inch display itself.

The second is a model of an interface to the rear spring-loaded tabs on the rear of the display. By itself, this doesn't do much, but it is intended to be integrated into other things.

The third is a simple adapter to turn the display into a name badge. Take a safety pin and clip it around the back (the curved pieces will accommodate a variety of safety pin sizes) and wear it like a name badge.
